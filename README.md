## General Information
Platform style game inspired by the classic iOS game [DoodleJump](https://doodlejump.io) from 2009 but implemented from scratch in Java. The work done so far represents the minimum viable product and it's still very much a work in progress.


## Technologies Used
- Java
- SimpleGraphics Library


## Setup
Option 1 - [Download here](CodeAcademyJumpers.jar) the .jar file in this repo and run it from your computer, either macOS or Windows should work fine.

Option 2 - [Download here](https://github.com/JohnLacerdaOliveira/CodeAcademyJumpers) the intire repo and run open it with IntellJ or any other JDK IDE and compile and run the project from there.


## Project Status
Minimum viable product, much left to do


## Features
- Infinity scroll (plataforms will be continuously generated and deleted as you continue moving up)
- Persistent high score
- Code implemented in such a way that player physics and number of platforms on screen can be dynamicly changed


## Room for Improvement
- Multithread implementation
- Physics improvements
- Increasing difficulty as game progresses
- Moving platforms
- Starter menu
- Player Selection
